Themes

`v0` only includes Monokai support. Eventually I'm going to add a few other defaults and ``.tmTheme`` parsing. Right now I'm just trying to finish a blog post I started three weeks ago that's now spawned three Python packages.

Wishlist
--------

These are things that I'd like to add but don't haven't added yet. It's not a roadmap; I don't have a release schedule.

* ``less`` instead of ``css``
* ``tmTheme`` parsing
* font conversion
* examples
* ``git`` hooks
* pygit2
